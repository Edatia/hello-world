# hello-world
A getting to know things first attempt at this.

Newbie's first edit:
Hi there! All this Git/GitHub stuff is new to me.
It would be interesting to not have to do this version control stuff manually though.

Second edit:
I'm just going to keep typing and typing because I would like to figure out how the text wrap and carriage return stuff works - or doesn't as the case may be. No carriage return between sentences just to see how all of this plays out when I commit this second edit.
